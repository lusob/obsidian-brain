# üß† Obsidian brAIn plugin

This plugin enables a ChatGPT powered chatbot specifically focused on question answering over your Obsidian vault notes(markdown files).

### üß∞ Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### üìñ How to use

1. Install the plugin in your Obsidian vault by going to `Settings -> Community Plugins -> Browse` and searching for `brAIn`.
2. After installation, In the settings section of the plugin, enter your OpenAI API key to enable the plugin to ingest your vault documents and to use the chat.
3. Feed the model with your notes your vault notes running `brAIn: Ingest vault docs` command in the command palette or by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + P`.
4. From now on you can also talk with your brAIn by clicking on the brain button in the ribbon or running `brAIn: Open chat` command in the command palette or by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + P`.

*If you have new notes that you want to be indexed by the brAIn just run again `brAIn: Ingest vault docs`*

### üõ† How it works

The plugin uses a Docker container running the brAIn server to enable the chatbot functionality. The brAIn server reads in your Obsidian vault documents and uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to enable the question answering functionality. Once the server is running, you can chat with the bot through the plugin's interface.
